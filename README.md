# ESP32 Wi-Fi Connect Manager Example

This is my code example with usage of ESP-IDF and WebSocket data exchange.

## Folder contents

The project **ESP-CONNECT-MNGR** contains source files in C language are located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
